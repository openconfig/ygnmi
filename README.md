# ygnmi
## Introduction

ygnmi is a A Go gNMI client library based on [ygot](github.com/openconfig/ygot)-generated code. It includes a generator whose input is a set of YANG modules and output is ygot Go structs and a path library that can be used for making gNMI queries.

The library supports querying telemetry and unmarshaling it into generated structs and setting config. Only gnmi.Subscribe and gnmi.Set RPC are supported by this library.

This project is under active development and does not provide any compatibility or stability guarantees.

Note: This is not an official Google product.

## Generation

The ygnmi generator can be installed by running: `go install github.com/openconfig/ygnmi/app/ygnmi@latest`.

For the most up-to-date documentation of the generator commands and flags: use the built-in `help` command.
An example generation script is located at internal/exampleoc/gen.sh.

Not all ygot generator flags are supported by ygnmi. Notably ygnmi makes two important assumptions about the generated code:

1. Path compression is enabled.
2. PreferOperationState is selected.

Note: the supported flags may evolve over time to include these options.
